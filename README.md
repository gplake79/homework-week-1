## Description

A marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. A codebase that follows accessibility standards
so that our own site is optimized for search engines is required.

## What did we do?

- Replaced HTML elements with semantic HTML elements.
- Made images more accessible by adding alt attributes.
- Fixed nav bar link bug.
- Updated the title of the website for SEO.
- Formatted code using lint (prettier)

## Getting started

- Clone the GitHub project on you local machine.
- Navigate into the project.
- Open the project in VSCode.
- Open the 'index.html' file in your default browser.

git clone gplake79.github.io/homework-week-1
cd homework
